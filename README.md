# Daily Nikon

A website for displaying photographs taken during the Covid-19 pandemic using a Nikon camera. An experimental project to practice working with new tools and image rendering. Plus some silly amateur photography on the side. 

Made using Gatsby, AWS S3 and Netlify. 

To run locally use a .env.development with correct key and access id. 

Deploy with Netlify with correct .env.production variables.
