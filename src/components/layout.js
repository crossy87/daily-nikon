					<h3>Photography & Web Development</h3>
					<p>
						After the novelty of a forced working from home had worn off, I needed a creative outlet to allow myself to do something that wasn't work related.
					</p>
					<p>
						I dusted off a Nikon camera my aunt had given to me and decided to make a start at figuring out how to use it!
					</p>
					<p>
						Whilst I enjoy taking snaps of the world around me; of the things that bring me joy, I also thought this would be a good excuse to experiment with some web development tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						This website has been made with Gatsby, AWS S3 and Netlify. It is an ongoing project, subject to constant tweaks and modifications as I continue learning.
